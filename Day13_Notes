What do you remember from the last class?

Page Object Model

    What is POM?

        *It is a framework design pattern
        *We separate page objects and action test cases
        *We store page objects in a different class, we use them in test classes
            *We use @FindBy annotation to locate the page object in page class
        *Page Factory: It is used in constructor in the pages to instantiate the objects
    Why POM?

        *Reuseability
        *Easy maintainance
        *Readibility
        *Time sever
