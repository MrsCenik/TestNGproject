-Assertions:
        -Hard Assertion: Stops test executions when the Assertion line fails
        -Soft Assertion: Continues to the test execution evet if the Assertion line fails.
                         To use soft assertion we have to create softAssert object
                           SoftAssert sa = new SortAssert();
                           sa.assertTrue() .. or other assertions you can use
                           sa.assertAll()
